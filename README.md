Mobile I/O
============
Handy app that allows a user to utilize a smartphone in order to control a computer via mouse and predefined keyboard shortcuts. The infrastructure is setup in a way that allows additions of new shortcuts and capabilities using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

As of now the default configuration allows for basic mouse control (movement and click) found at '/(LOCAL\_IP):8000/mouse' and rotational control at '\<LOCAL\_IP\>:8000/rotate'.

## Requirements ##
The app requires:
- Java 
- Both mobile phone and computer must be connected to the same network

## Remarks ##
- On certain operating systems it may be necessary to turn off the firewall in order to allow the local IP address to be reachable from other devices on the same network
